# SimpleMachine
In this project I try to make it possible to add machines to minecraft.
Minecraft is an online video game where you are able to survive. The game offers the option to add various functions to the game itself.
This is the reason I try to bring machines into the game.
The machine will produce products that will then be delivered to their intended destination on a conveyor belt. 
At their end point, they will be collected by a collector that can then be opened by the player and from which he can retrieve the items.
