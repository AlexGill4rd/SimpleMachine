# SimpleMachine
In this project I try to make it possible to add machines to minecraft.

# Minecraft
Minecraft is an online video game where you are able to survive. The game offers the option to add various functions to the game itself.
This is the reason I try to bring machines into the game.

# How will it work?
The machine will produce products that will then be delivered to their intended destination on a conveyor belt. 
At their end point, they will be collected by a collector that can then be opened by the player and from which he can retrieve the items.
There will also be a system that uses fuel for the machine. This will need to be replenished from time to time.

# What language
I create the plugin using Java. I do the programming in Intellij and here you have a tool to start your plugin in an easy way.
